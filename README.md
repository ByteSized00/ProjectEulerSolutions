# ProjectEulerSolutions

This contains all my Project Euler (projecteuler.net) solutions for each language I am learning. It is starting off with C++ and then will be continued in Python and next Assembly. The goal of this is to not just find the solution but to learn how to find the same solution across several languages and utilize each language's strengths with good programming practices when finding the solution.
